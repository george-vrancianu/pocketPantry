/**
 * Builds a fetcher with the SSRF address guard.
 *
 * - Schemes: http and https only, on the first URL and on every redirect hop
 *   (so `file:`, `ftp:`, `data:`, `javascript:` are refused). A redirect from
 *   https to http is allowed: every hop is checked again anyway, and nothing
 *   secret is sent.
 * - URL credentials (`user:pass@`) are refused. Odd IPv4 literals
 *   (`2130706433`, `0x7f.1`, `0177.0.0.1`, `127.1`) are normalised to dotted
 *   quad by `new URL()` and so checked like any address.
 * - The host is resolved once per hop (all addresses). If ANY address is not
 *   allowed the hop is refused; otherwise the request connects to the first
 *   address by IP (`host: ip`) with the original hostname kept as the Host
 *   header and TLS `servername`, so there is no second DNS lookup between
 *   check and connect and certificates are still checked against the hostname.
 * - Redirects are followed manually (301/302/303/307/308), relative Location
 *   resolved against the current URL, at most `maxRedirects`.
 * - No proxy: requests use `node:http(s)` with `agent: false` (a fresh private
 *   agent), so neither HTTP(S)_PROXY nor `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY`, which only
 *   configure the global agents, can route around the guard.
 * - Size: the body is counted as it streams and the request is destroyed over
 *   the cap; an over-cap Content-Length is refused early. We send
 *   `Accept-Encoding: identity` and refuse any other Content-Encoding, so
 *   there is nothing to decompress (no gzip bombs).
 * - Timeout: one AbortController deadline covers lookup, connect, TLS,
 *   headers and body across all hops (a slow-drip body times out).
 * - Content type: `text/html` or `application/xhtml+xml` (case-insensitive,
 *   parameters allowed). A missing Content-Type is refused. The body is decoded
 *   with the Content-Type `charset` when `TextDecoder` knows it, else UTF-8
 *   (no `<meta>` sniffing).
