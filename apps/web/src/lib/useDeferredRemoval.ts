/**
 * Remove a record with Undo (ADR 0009). `remove` hides the record at once and
 * shows an Undo toast; `send` (the real delete) only runs when that toast
 * ends: it times out, is dismissed or replaced by another toast, or the Member
 * leaves the page. Undo just shows the record again and makes no request.
 *
 * Filter `hiddenIds` out of the list you render, so a refetch cannot bring a
 * removed record back. A record stays hidden until `send` has settled; if it
 * rejects the record comes back with an error toast. Only the latest removal
 * can be undone.
 *
 * `send` must resolve only once the cache no longer holds the record (put the
 * response in the cache with `setQueryData` in the mutation's `onSuccess`, or
 * return the `invalidateQueries` promise), otherwise the row flashes back.
 * Pass `mutateAsync`, not `mutate`: per-call callbacks are dropped when a
 * newer `mutate` runs. The hook cancels in-flight refetches of `queryKey`
 * (the list's query key) before it calls `mutateAsync`, so a poll cannot
 * resurrect the row.
 *
 * `discard` drops a waiting removal without sending it, for when the record is
 * written again before its Undo window ends.
 *
 * `removeMany` removes several records as one removal: one Undo window, one toast, and one call to
 * `mutateManyAsync` with all the ids when the window ends. Undo brings all of them back. It is still
 * the latest removal, of one record or many, that can be undone.
 *
 * The error toast replaces a newer Undo toast and so sends that delete early;
 * that is intended (ADR 0009: a new toast sends any pending delete).
