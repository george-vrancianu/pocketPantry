# Assistant Requests may check Shopping Items

With the PantryGator rebrand, Members want to say "Hey Siri, Gator got", then "milk", in the shop. ADR 0019 refused checking a Shopping Item without Review, along with removing items and changing stock. We amend its allow-list to add one kind: **checking a Shopping Item that is already on the Shopping List**. A wrong check stays visible on the list and is undone by unchecking it, and nothing reaches the Pantry until Finish Shopping goes through Review. Unchecking, removing, and adding or removing Batches stay refused. A name that matches no unchecked Shopping Item writes nothing, and the spoken reply says so.

The Shortcuts are published as four Siri phrases on the same endpoint and Assistant Token: "Pantry add" (kept for existing Members), "Gator needs", "Gator got" and "Gator, do we have" (Pantry Questions, ADR 0020). A one-breath phrase such as "Gator needs milk" needs a native app with App Intents and stays deferred, as in ADR 0019.
